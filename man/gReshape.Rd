\title{Reshapes a one-fish-per-line data frame to a one-measurement-per-line data frame.}
\usage{
gReshape(
  df,
  in.pre,
  id.var,
  var.name = "prvAge",
  val.name = in.pre,
  last.plus = NULL,
  na.rm = TRUE,
  drop = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame that contains the growth measurement data in one-fish-per-line format with specifics as defined in the details.}

\item{in.pre}{A string that represents the common start to the measurement variable names.  See details.}

\item{id.var}{A vector of variables in \code{df} that do not change.  See details.}

\item{var.name}{A string that indicates the name in the reshaped data frame that represents the level of the measurement variables in the original data frame.}

\item{val.name}{A string that indicates the name in the reshaped data frame that represents the measurements in the orginal data frame.}

\item{last.plus}{A string that if non-null indicates that the last measurement represents \dQuote{plus growth} and not an actual increment.  If \dQuote{plus growth} is recorded then this string should indicate the name of the variable in \code{df} that contains the age of the fish at capture.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical that indicates whether \code{NA} values in the measurement variables should be removed after reshaping.}

\item{drop}{A vector of variable names to drop before reshaping.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame in one-measurement-per-line format.  See details.

\description{
Converts growth data from the one-fish-per-line format to the one-measurement-per-line format.  One-fish-per-line format is a common form for collecting or storing growth data.  One-measurement-per-line format is required for many statistical analyses.
}
\details{
This function does NOT convert the data from radial to incremental or incremental to radial measurements.

The input data frame in \code{df} must have the following specific formats.  First, the measurements of annular increments or radii must be in one-fish-per-line format.  The measurements must be contained in columns that are named with a common prefix (e.g., \dQuote{anu}, \dQuote{inc}, or \dQuote{rad}) followed by a number that represents the age of the fish when that portion of the structure formed.  This prefix must be the same for all columns that contains measurements and \bold{must not be found in any other variable (as a prefix or not)}.  For example, the first annular measurement should be in a variable named \dQuote{anu1}, the second annular measurement in \dQuote{anu2}, and so on.  The name of the prefix should be included in the \code{in.pre=} argument.

If \code{id.var} is left blank then the vector of variables that will not be changed upon the reshaping will consist of all variables that do NOT start with the \code{in.pre} prefix.

Errors may occur if a particular variable in the original data frame, to be included in the \code{id.var=} list, is of POSIX type.  A workaround for this error is to include the name of that variable in \code{drop=}.

The name of the variable in the reshaped output data frame that contains the measurements will be called the same as \code{in.pre} by default.  This can be changed by including a new name as a string in \code{val.name}.

  data(SMBassWB)
  head(SMBassWB)

  # convert radial measurements to increments
  SMBi1 <- gConvert(SMBassWB,in.pre="anu",type="inc")
  head(SMBi1)

  SMBi1a <- gReshape(SMBi1,in.pre="inc")
  head(SMBi1a)

  # same as above but assume that last increment (in agecap variable) is plus-growth
  SMBi2a <- gReshape(SMBi1,in.pre="inc",last.plus="agecap")
  head(SMBi2a)

  # example of dropping some variables before reshaping
  SMBi1b <- gReshape(SMBi1,in.pre="inc",drop=c("species","lake"))
  head(SMBi1b)
