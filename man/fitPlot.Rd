\item{\dots}{Other arguments to be passed to the plot functions.}

\item{plot.pts}{A logical that indicates (\code{TRUE} (default)) whether the points are plotted along with the fitted lines. Set to \code{FALSE} to plot just the fitted lines.}

\item{pch}{A numeric or vector of numerics that indicates what plotting character codes should be used. In SLR this is the single value to be used for all points. In IVR a vector is used to identify the characters for the levels of the second factor.}

\item{col.pt}{A string used to indicate the color of the plotted points. Used only for SLR and logistic regression objects.}

\item{lwd}{A numeric used to indicate the line width of the fitted line.}

\item{lty}{A numeric or vector of numerics used to indicate the type of line used for the fitted line. In SLR this is a single value to be used for the fitted line. In IVR a vector is used to identify the line types for the levels of the second factor. See \code{par}.}

\item{interval}{In SLR or IVR, a string that indicates whether to plot confidence (\code{="confidence"}) or prediction (\code{="prediction"}) intervals. For a SLR object both can be plotted by using \code{="both"}. In one-way or two-way ANOVA, a logical that indicates whether the confidence intervals should be plotted or not.}

\item{conf.level}{A decimal numeric that indicates the level of confidence to use for confidence and prediction intervals.}

\item{lty.ci}{a numeric used to indicate the type of line used for the confidence band lines for SLR objects or interval lines for one-way and two-way ANOVA. For IVR, the confidence band types are controlled by \code{lty}.}

\item{lty.pi}{a numeric used to indicate the type of line used for the prediction band lines for SLR objects. For IVR, the prediction band types are controlled by \code{lty}. See \code{par}.}

\item{xlab}{a string for labeling the x-axis.}

\item{ylab}{a string for labeling the y-axis.}

\item{ylim}{A vector of length two to control the y-axis in the nonlinear regression plot.}

\item{type}{The type of graphic to construct in a one-way and two-way ANOVA. If \code{"b"} then points are plotted and lines are used to connect points (DEFAULT). If \code{"p"} then only points are used and if \code{"l"} then only lines are drawn.}

\item{col}{A vector of color names or the name of a palette (from \code{\link[grDevices]{hcl.pals}}) that indicates what color of points and lines to use for the levels of the first factor in an IVR or the second factor in a two-way ANOVA.}

The default is to use the internal \code{iCIfp} function which will place t-distribution based confidence intervals on the graph. The user can provide alternative functions that may plot other types of \sQuote{error bars}. See examples in \code{\link[sciplot]{lineplot.CI}} function of \pkg{sciplot} package.}

\item{col.ci}{A vector of color names or numbers or the name of a palette (see details) that indicates what colors to use for the confidence interval bars in one-way and two-way ANOVAs.}

\item{which}{A character string listing the factor in the two-way ANOVA for which the means should be calculated and plotted. This argument is used to indicate for which factor a main effects plot should be constructed. If left missing then an interaction plot is constructed.}

\item{transparency}{A numeric that indicates how many points would be plotted on top of each other in a logistic regression before the \sQuote{point} would have the full \code{pt.col} color. The reciprocal of this value is the alpha transparency value.}

\item{plot.p}{A logical that indicates if the proportion for categorized values of X are plotted (\code{TRUE}; default).}

\item{breaks}{A number that indicates how many intervals over which to compute proportions or a numeric vector that contains the endpoints of the intervals over which to compute proportions if \code{plot.p=TRUE}.}

\item{yaxis1.lbls}{A numeric vector that indicates labels for the tick marks on the left y-axis (for the proportion of \sQuote{successes}) for the logistic regression plot.}

\item{yaxis2.show}{A logical that indicates whether the right y-axis should be created (\code{=TRUE}; default) or not for the logistic regression plot.}

\item{mdl.vals}{A numeric that represents the number of values to use for plotting the logistic regression. A larger number means a smoother line.}

\item{xlim}{A vector of length two to control the x-axis in the logistic regression plot. If this is changed from the default then the domain over which the logistic regression model is plotted will change.}

\description{
A generic function for constructing a fitted model plot for an \code{lm}, \code{glm}, or \code{nls} object. Supported objects are linear models from simple linear regression (SLR), indicator variable regression (IVR), one-way ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA models; general linear models that are logistic regressions with a binary response; and non-linear regression with a single numerical response variable, at least one continuous explanatory variable and up to two group-factor explanatory variables.
}
\details{
This function does not work with a multiple linear regression, indicator variable regressions with more than two factors, ANOVAs other than one-way and two-way, or models with a categorical response variable. In addition, if the linear model contains a factor then the model must be fit with the quantitative explanatory variable first, followed by the factor(s). This function only works for non-linear models with two or fewer groups.

This function is basically a wrapper to a variety of other functions. For one-way or two-way ANOVAs the primary functions called are \code{interaction.plot} and \code{lineplot.CI}. For simple linear regression the function performs similarly to \code{abline} except that the line is constrained to the domain. For indicator variable regression the function behaves as if several \code{abline} functions had been called.

A legend can be added to the plot in three different ways. First, if \code{legend = TRUE} then the R console is suspended until the user places the legend on the graphic by clicking on the graphic at the point where the upper-left corner of the legend should appear. Second, the \code{legend=} argument can be set to one of \code{"bottomright"}, \code{"bottom"}, \code{"bottomleft"}, \code{"left"}, \code{"topleft"}, \code{"top"}, \code{"topright"}, \code{"right"} and \code{"center"}. In this case, the legend will be placed inside the plot frame at the given location. Finally, the \code{legend=} argument can be set to a vector of length two which identifies the plot coordinates for the upper-left corner of where the legend should be placed. A legend will not be drawn if \code{legend = FALSE} or \code{legend = NULL}. A legend also will not be drawn if there are not multiple groups in the model.
}
\note{
This function is meant to allow newbie students the ability to visualize the most common linear models found in an introductory or intermediate level undergraduate statistics course without getting \dQuote{bogged-down} in the gritty details of a wide variety of functions. This generic function and it's S3 functions allow the student to visualize the means plot of a one-way anova, the main effects and interaction plots of a two-way ANOVA, the fit of a simple linear regression, the fits of many lines in an indicator variable regression, and the fit of a non-linear model with a simple and mostly common set of arguments -- generally, all that is required is a fitted linear model of the type mentioned here as the first argument. This function thus allows newbie students to interact with and visualize moderately complex linear models in a fairly easy and efficient manner. THIS IS NOT A RESEARCH GRADE FUNCTION and the user should learn how to use the functions that this function is based on, build plots from \dQuote{scratch}, or use more sophisticated plotting packages (e.g., \pkg{ggplot2} or \pkg{lattice}).
