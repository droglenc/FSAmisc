# FSAmisc
## Introduction
This is the github page for in progress or miscellaneous functions eventually destined for the FSA (Fisheries Stock Assessment) package for R developed by [Derek Ogle](http://droglenc.wordpress.com/) at [Northland College](http://www.northland.edu/).  These functions have not been fully tested -- **use with caution and suspicion**.

## Installation
This package can be installed from github to your R with the following code

```r
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools'); require('devtools')
devtools::install_github('droglenc/FSAmisc')
```

Descriptions of recent changes can be found in the [News.md file](https://github.com/droglenc/FSAmisc/blob/master/NEWS.md)
